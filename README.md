### Arxiver

The point of this script it to scrape the arXiv and download the titles of certain publications of interest.
My interests are typically Astrophysics, Computer vision and AI. 
Idea is:
print Topic Name heading
	print List of paper-titles
		if interesting paper:
			Click on the name:
				Download pdf()
Libraries required: 
os, Tkinter, BeautifulSoup, itertools, urllib2. 

I got stuck up trying to make a scrollbar for the tkinter canvas. An excellent asnwer on stackoverflow saved me:

This is done just during my free time to make reading papers easier. Hope people find good uses of this piece of code!
